# Handwritten Digit Recognition

## About
This project is based on handwritten digit recognition using machine learning.  
The aim is to build a model that can identify digits (0–9) from handwritten images.

---

## Problem
Handwritten digits look different for every person.  
Because of this variation, recognizing digits automatically is not easy.  
In this project, a machine learning model is trained to solve this problem.

## Dataset
- MNIST Handwritten Digit Dataset  
- 28×28 grayscale images  
- Digits from 0 to 9  

---

## Tools Used
- Python  
- NumPy   
- Matplotlib  
- Scikit-learn  
- Jupyter Notebook  

---

## Work Done
- Loaded and explored the dataset  
- Preprocessed image data  
- Trained a classification model  
- Tested the model on unseen data  

---

## Result
The model is able to recognize handwritten digits with good accuracy and gives correct predictions for most test samples.
